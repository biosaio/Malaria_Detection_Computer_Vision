# Malaria infected cell detection project

In this project we compared different methods for object detection in the context of a dataset of malaria infected cells.
The objective is to classify cells between infected and uninfected.
We implemented four different pipelines using popular algorithms, such as U-NET, RT-DETR, Faster-RCNN, YOLO

The results, as well as the detailed experimental setup, can be explored in the report.

Pre-processing of the images is done in RCNN notebook.
